# Members and Email plugin

A plugin to collect data, to help draw people into the Wordpress site.

This plugin is designed to give Wordpress users and creators ability to go deeper into the site.
It is a good thing for users to go deep into the site because it makes it easier to serve ads and
cater to the audience. Not to mention, visitors would love to go deeper into the brand of a website.



    *Think of when a customer is a fan of Nike and then enters the Nike factory store.
    The customer gets a deeper and meaningful brand experience.*


## Concepts
*  Pursue the option of using Facebook as a way to contact people vs. Email
*  Make this as Social media centric as possible. Keep people exposed to the brand for as long as possible.
*  
*  




## Implemented
* A shortcode that can be displayed on a post that displays a form. The form data feeds into a PHPmyAdmin table.
*

## Plans/TODO
* Custom post types
* I am inspired by 'ARI Adminer' I like the backend admin suite.
* I am considering adding an email popup.
* Social login, have members log in to the site with Facebook.
* Collect billing data on members, and if not, create a method to collect necessary data using the least amount
  of fields possible.

## Maybe / Thinking About Doing
* Adding an email popup.
    - Email popups can be bad for user experience. Due to them not blending in with the website.
